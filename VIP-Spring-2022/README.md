1. Data Visualization - the graph screenshots are results of each of the visulization attempts with regards to cohesion and the friction angle (phi). Additionally each output parameter has its own python file that reads in the dataframe from the output_mod.csv file and outputs the respective histograms illustrating the data distribution.
2. Support Vector Machines - the svm.py file contains the script to fit a support vector machine model on the normalized dataset and evaluates the accuracy metrics using the Sklearn library.
